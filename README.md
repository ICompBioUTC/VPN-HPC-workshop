# How to use GitHub Personal Access Tokens

GitHub is moving away from using passwords when authorizing in terminal. This is how you can get a Personal Access Token which you use in place of your password.

Go to your GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens then hit `Generate new token`. From there, choose which options you need. For most basic things, you only need the repo controls. When you're done, hit `Generate token`. 

Once you have your token, when prompted in terminal to enter your GitHub credentials, use your username or email like normal and then the token you just created in place of your password.
